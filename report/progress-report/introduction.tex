\section{Introduction}

Having penetration tested the Wondough bank website, a number of security flaws were subsequently found. The ten most critical vulnerabilities were then fixed as
well as automated tests devised such that it were possible to entirely ensure the robustness of the new system. Below each of the vulnerabilities are outlined alongside
the relevent fix and the tests devised to guarantee the success of my improved system. \textbf{Please be aware} as described in chapter 11, the website must run on port 1464 to
work. This change was made to ensure a fix to the Oauth vulnerability. This change has been made to the source code on the client side already.
