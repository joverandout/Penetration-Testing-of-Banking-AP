\section{Vulnerability: PBKDF2 Iterations}
\label{sec:background}
\textbf{Description:} The password hashing in the wondough website uses PBKDF2. This pseudorandom hashing algorithm has a field called 'iterations', which is the number of times
the PRF will be applied to the password when deriving the key. The number iterations was deemed to need to be 1000 as early as 2000, and A Kerberos standard in 2005 recommended
4096 iterations. Therefore the current iteration set as 1 is an entirely unacceptable amount. \begin{center}

     \hline
     Password Complexity & Entropy estimate & 1000 iterations &  10000 iterations\\ 
     \hline
     Comprehensive8 & 33 & 4 hours 46 minutes & 47 hours \\ 
     8 random lowercase letters & 37 & 12 hours & 5 days \\ 
     8 random letters & 45 & 123 days & 3 years 5 months \\
     8 randmon characters & 52 & 325 years & 3250 years \\
